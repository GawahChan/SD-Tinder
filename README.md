# SD-Tinder

Are you a director looking for the next perfect stunt double for your new movie?
Then try out SD-Tinder, the quick and easy way to find the perfect candidate for you!

This personal project is inspired by Tinder and uses a similar UI. The user is presented with a stack of profile cards of different stunt doubles, where the user can 'like', 'dislike' or 'superlike' the profile by either clicking on the buttons,or utilise a swiping mechanism similar to Tinder. The actions of the user will be displayed on the results page either at the end of going through all the profiles or using the "results" link in the Menu section.
